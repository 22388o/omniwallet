## Setup:

update ~/.sx.cfg with an obelisk server details.  Don't have one already set up?  Here's how to build on on Rackspace: [[https://gist.github.com/curtislacy/8424181]]
```
# ~/.sx.cfg Sample file.
service = "tcp://162.243.29.201:9091"
```
Make sure you have python libraries installed.
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install ecdsa
sudo pip install pycoin
```
Run npm install
```
npm install
```
